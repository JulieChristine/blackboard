    <h1>Ember JS Objectives</h1>
    <p>This week, we'll explore the <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember JavaScript</a> framework. Ember.js defines itself as "a framework for creating ambitious web applications". </p>
    <p>As web applications gain increasingly rich and complex user interfaces, a new breed of tools called "client-side MVCs" have emerged to help developers be more productive and build these user interfaces more easily. Ember.js strives to be the best choice for these "ambitious" web applications by providing a framework that enforces good code organization with "convention over configuration" and provides many tools for common development practices.</p>
    <p>Concepts and tools that we'll use in the next two weeks include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MVC</li>
      <li>"Convention over configuration"</li>
      <li>Routes</li>
      <li>Handlebars</li>
      <li>Templates</li>
      <li>Ember Data and models</li>
      <li>Firebase</li>
      <li>Components</li>
      <li>Custom helpers</li>
      <li>Services</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Independent Project Objectives</h3>
    <p>At the end of the week, you should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use routes to control navigation through your application.</li>
      <li>Use Handlebars to create dynamic elements in templates.</li>
      <li>Persist data with models, Ember Data and Firebase.</li>
      <li>Manipulate data between models and templates using components.</li>
      <li>Create a working application using Ember.</li>
      <li>Discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.</li>
    </ul>
